## Project Overview

this project focuses on creating a clean, fully responsive personal portfolio website that represents my skills, projects, and professional identity. The design follows a mobile first approach, each page is built for smaller screens first and then scaled up smoothly for tablets and desktop layouts.



# the website includes six core pages:

* Home page
* Contact page
* about page
* resume page
* projects page
* sample project page



# Purpose of the project

this project demonstrates my ability to:

* build a multi-page, responsive website
* Apply mobile first design principles
* use CSS/TailwindCSS for clean UI styling
* add interactivity with JavaScript
* Test HTMK and CSS across multiple browsers to ensure compatibility
* plan layouts using wireframes
* Use git Git for version control and push updates to GitHub with clear commits.
